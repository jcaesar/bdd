Example calculations (probably for some circuits) stolen from buddy (http://sourceforge.net/p/buddy/gitcode/ci/master/tree/examples/bddcalc/examples/), which in turn probably stole them from http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/brglez/CBL/benchmarks/Benchmarks-upto-1996.html where they are no longer available.
